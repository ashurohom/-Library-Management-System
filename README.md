# Library Management System üìö

## Introduction
The **Library Management System** is a web-based application built using **Django** and **Django Rest Framework (DRF)**. It allows administrators to manage books efficiently, including adding, updating, and deleting book records. The system also includes **user authentication, CSRF protection, and validation mechanisms** to ensure secure and reliable data management.

## Technologies Used üõ†Ô∏è
- **Backend:** Django, Django Rest Framework (DRF), Python
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (if applicable)
- **Database:** SQLite/MySQL
- **Authentication:** Django's built-in User Model
- **Security Features:** CSRF Protection, Form Validation

## Features ‚úÖ
- **User Authentication:** Signup, Login, Logout
- **Book Management:** Add, Update, Delete, View Books
- **Validation Mechanisms:**
  - Required fields validation
  - Password match validation
  - Unique email validation for admin signup
- **Security:**
  - CSRF tokens for secure data transmission
  - Django's built-in authentication
- **REST API Implementation (DRF)**

## Project Explanation üìù
This system is designed to **simplify library book management** by enabling admins to efficiently manage books through a web-based interface. The project uses **Django's authentication system** to ensure only authorized users can make changes. All forms include **CSRF tokens** for protection against cross-site request forgery attacks. Additionally, **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** allows for **API-based interactions** for potential integration with other systems.
